          The Liquidity Bootstrapping Event (LBE) is designed to bolster
          liquidity for the TEDY/ADA pool at launch. Participants can exchange
          ADA for TEDY at a ratio of 0.444 TEDY per ADA, starting Nov 23rd, 2:00
          PM UTC.

          <b>Pro-Rata Distribution Explained</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          The LBE facilitates an equitable distribution of TEDY tokens in
          exchange for ADA contributions. Here&apos;s an outline of the process:
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>All Contributions Counted:</b> We accept all ADA contributions
          during the 3-hour LBE window, irrespective of the 1.8 million ADA cap.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Proportional Allocation:</b> TEDY tokens are allocated in
          proportion to each participant&apos;s contribution compared to the
          total ADA received.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Refunding Excess:</b> Contributions beyond the 1.8 million ADA cap
          are proportionally refunded, ensuring each participant receives their
          rightful share of TEDY tokens.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Example:</b> If the total ADA received is 3.6 million and you
          contribute 36,000 ADA, your share is 1% of the total (36,000 /
          3,600,000). Consequently, you receive 1% of the 800,000 TEDY tokens
          (8,000 TEDY) and a 50% refund of your ADA contribution (18,000 ADA),
          in line with the oversubscription.
          <br />
          <br />
          This approach guarantees fair distribution, full participation within
          the timeframe, and upholds the tokenomics integrity by returning
          surplus ADA.
